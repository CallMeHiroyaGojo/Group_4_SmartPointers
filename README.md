The following lines is a word-by-word copy of this group assignment description.

---

In this project you will review some advanced features of C++ and related libraries. Your instructor do not expect you to be an expert on your groups choice of the topic. However, he expect that you will learn the basics of the topic at the conclusion of the project. He will guide you through the project on what to do and where to look, etc. So do not worry if you do not know anything on the topic at first. 

## Learning objectives of this  project are to:

1. review and practice C++ coding 
2. get  familiar with advanced C++ features 
3. practice scientific writing related to computer science 
4. gain Git and GitHub experience
5. gain talk and presentation experience 

## Topics: 

One topic per group. Please select one. Selection is first come first served. Once picked by a group, that topic is not available to others; two groups can't have the same topic. Once picked, each group must create a group discussion with the same topic they picked. Then the instructor will give you further guidance such as where to look and what to do specifically for each project. The instructor will communicate you through this discussion channel.
