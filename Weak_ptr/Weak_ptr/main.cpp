/*
 This program demonstrates how weak pointers can be used.
 1. First we set up a simple class called Box.
 2. In main() we create an instance of box called b1.
 3. Then we create a few shared pointers to the b1 object.
 4. We create a weak pointer.
 5. We use the weak pointer to demonstrate that the b1 object is not "alive".
 6. We demonstrate what happens if we don't use a weak pointer.

    // "The b1 object is no longer "alive" is printed to the console.

    // "alive".
